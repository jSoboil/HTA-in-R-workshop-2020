# Introduction
- Markov models are the most commonly used models for economic evaluation of health technologies

- Due to the Markov assumption, it is not straightforward (requires tunnel states) to incorporate time dependency

- Semi-Markov models can model time dependency in a very flexible manner but require individual patient simulation (IPS), which is computationally expensive

- The [`hesim`](https://hesim-dev.github.io/hesim/) package provides a general framework for simulating semi-Markov models very quickly and using them to perform cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA)

# What is `hesim`?
> - A modular and computationally efficient `R` package for health economic simulation modeling and decision analysis that provides a general framework for integrating statistical analyses with economic evaluation

- Supports both cohort and **individual-level** state transition models

- Parameterized by fitting a statistical model (e.g., multi-state model) or creating a custom parameter object

- Nearly all simulation code written in `C++` under the hood

# Timescales   

+ **Markov (i.e., "clock forward")** implies that the hazard function is based on time since entering the initial state
+ **semi-Markov (i.e., "clock reset")** implies that the hazard function is based on time since entering each state (i.e., the clock resets to 0 after each transition)

# Simulating disease progression
- IPS is required to simulate clock-reset models; can also be used for clock-forward models

- IPS works by simulating trajectories through the multi-state model with random number generation for a large number of patients

- Purpose of IPS is to compute expected values, which is operationalized by averaging over a large number of simulatd patients

# Computational efficiency
- `hesim` uses `C++` to vectorize over treatment strategies, patients, and PSA iterations. 

- Simulation is very fast if efficient random number generation functions have been implemented in base `R` or a closed-form expression exists for the quantile function (all parametric distributions)

- If not (e.g., splines, fractional polynomials), simulation is slower. Must either:

    + Compute quantile function numerically and use inverse CDF method
    + Use discrete time approximation and sample from Bernoulli distribution

# Simulating costs and QALYs
- Costs and QALYs are computed using the continuous time present value given a flow of state values

$$
\sum_{m = 1}^M \int_{t_m}^{t_m+1} z_{hm}e^{-rt}dt = \sum_{m = 1}^M z_{hm} \left(\frac{e^{-r{t_{m}}} - e^{-r{t_{m+1}}}}{r}\right)
$$

- The present value for health state $h$, $z_h$, can be predicted from a statistical model or predefined; can vary by treatment strategy, patient, and/or time.

- IPS is advantageous because state values can reset (e.g., costs in oncology can depend on time in progressed state due to changes in chemotherapy cycles)

# Speed tests
- [Comparison](https://devinincerti.com/2019/01/01/sim-mstate.html) of `$sim_disease()` to `mstate::mssample()` using Weibull 6-state model 

    + 1,000 patients, 100 PSA iterations: `hesim`= .44 seconds, `mstate` = 34 minutes
    + 1,000 patients, 1,000 PSA iterations: `hesim` = 5 seconds, `mstate` = N/A
    
- Comparison of `hesim` IPS (1,000 patients) to `heemod` cohort model (60 annual cycles) used to model two treatment strategies with the time-inhomogeneous Markov model from the [*Decision Modeling for Health Economic Evaluation*](https://www.herc.ox.ac.uk/downloads/decision-modelling-for-health-economic-evaluation) textbook

    + 1,000 PSA iterations: `hesim` = 9 seconds, `heemod` = 85 seconds \footnote{Run time for an equivalent cohort model in \texttt{hesim} was $\approx$ 1 second.}

# Summary

- Semi-Markov models are flexible because they can track patient history; hazards, costs, and/or utility can all depend on time in state (not just model time) 

- Although they can only be simulated in a general manner with IPS, `hesim` eliminates concerns about slow run times

- In addition to simulating disease progression, `hesim` can be used to (i) simulate cost/QALYs and (ii) perform CEA

- Some potential features to add: (i) function to update covariates during IPS, (ii) integration with multi-state network meta-analysis, and (iii) support for parallel computing.
